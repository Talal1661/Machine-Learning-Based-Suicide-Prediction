# Machine-Learning-Based-Suicide-Prediction

Suicide is a major issue all around the globe. There are multiple studies suggesting the steps that we need to take in order to control suicide rates. Machine Learning can be a vital source for monitoring and analyzing the reasons, causes, and demographic structure of patterns of suicide attempts and deaths.
Suicude rate is predicted using two Machine Learning algorithms, Linear Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron, two compare the results. Data is taken from different sources of public websites of US counties and combines in a single excel file which is tehn used in this project.
